            <p>Welcome to NBA Roster Shopping! Here you can try to construct a beast starting lineup using 5 
            current NBA players! (I set this up using Stripe) Try to strike a balance of inside scoring,
            veteran leadership, three point shooting, defense, etc. After you make your purchase, your roster
            will be evaluated on its chances of winning an NBA championship. Check out some of the players you
            can purchase in the Shopping Cart section!</p>
            <p>When you create your 5 players, you can even duplicate some players! Everyone's talking about how
            5 Lebrons would dominate against 5 Jordans...maybe that's true. Or maybe 3 Kyries and 2 Embiids is 
            just unstoppable. I've also sorted the players based on their positions, but you don't need to choose
            one from each category; you can pick 5 point guards if you want to. Who cares about positions anymore?</p>
            <p>To help evaluate Championship winning chances, each NBA player is given a rating, skills, and a
            price tag. Although NBA 2k has already given players ratings, they are inaccurate
            so I re-rated every NBA player. Note that you shouldn't just try to maximize ratings
            while minimizing prices; great NBA teams have a balanced skillset. For example, the 2019-20 Clippers
            had poor playmaking and thus lost in the second round. The championship metric will take into account 
            starpower and versatility.</p>
            <p>If you want a challenge, try to make an "Unstoppable" Championship Lineup while paying the least 
            amount possible. The Brooklyn Nets superteam is probably a "Favorite" Championship Lineup, but it is 
            costly. Strike a balance and email me if you think you have a good, cheap lineup.</p>
            <p>Finally, note that we are not affiliated with NBA 2k or any franchise not named the Chicago Bulls.
            I am not getting paid or sponsored to do this project; so please help me make a living by donations,
            which means purchasing the Russell Westbrook contract. Also, I prefer customers to not complain about 
            NBA player ratings or their final championship roster results; rosters will not be refunded once paid.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions or want to report technical issues, feel free to contact me at dzhu8 at
            uchicago dot edu. I will not answer roster refunds or player rating complaints. Have fun!</p>
